Welcome to gWebSocket.

This is a GWT implementation of the jWebSocket Client.

Please have a look at http://www.jwebsocket.org and https://developers.google.com/web-toolkit/ for detailed information. This implementation is based on JSON communication with WebSocket servers like jWebSocket Server.

Till now there are the following jWebSocket plugins implemented:

FileSystemPlugin
RPCPlugin
TokenPlugin

More plugins will follow at need but it is possible to do most of the work with this three plugins. If you have an idea for a new plugin needed please contact me. If you made a new plugin based on this code, please notify me too - so we can share it here, too.

If you have any problems please contact me.

There is a sample client showing some examples possible with the client. Please feel free to test and modify.
